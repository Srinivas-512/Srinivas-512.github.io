## 🎓 Biography
I am **Srinivasan Kidambi**, a Data Scientist at **Skan AI**, where I work on agentic automation systems, multimodal action discovery, and vision-language-action modeling for enterprise workflows. I recently completed my **B.Tech in Electrical Engineering with a Minor in AI & Machine Learning** at **IIT Madras**, where I developed a strong interest in **reinforcement learning, robotics, and efficient AI systems**.  

My research experience spans **hierarchical RL**, **model interpretability**, **efficient neural architectures**, and **hardware-aware deep learning**. 

Outside of work and research, I enjoy Indian classical music and have been learning how to play the violin for over eight years. I also enjoy trekking and playing video games.

<!-- 
I am broadly motivated by a long-term goal of building **robust, transparent, and deployable control policies** for robots operating in uncertain and unstructured environments. -->
