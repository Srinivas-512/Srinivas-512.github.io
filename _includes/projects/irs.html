    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      This undergraduate research project develops a <strong>phaseless DoA estimation</strong> algorithm
      for Intelligent Reflective Surfaces (IRS) and high-frequency (6G) systems. The method estimates
      azimuthal arrival using only Received Signal Strength (RSSI) across reconfigurable phased-array
      beam patterns (no phase measurements), coupling Uniform Linear Arrays (ULA) for symmetric beams
      with a Uniform Circular Array (UCA) for an asymmetric beam used to resolve sign ambiguity. For a full
      technical description see the project report.
    </p>

    <h3>Project Objectives</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Design a reliable DoA estimator using only RSSI from phased arrays (no phase data).</li>
      <li>Resolve left/right ambiguity using an asymmetric UCA beam and condition the estimator for low-sensitivity regions.</li>
      <li>Formulate an optimization over array weights to maximize differential-beam slope in low-sensitivity azimuth ranges.</li>
      <li>Demonstrate algorithmic performance in simulation and prepare for hardware validation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>
      The pipeline uses phased-array beamforming to produce a set of beams (two symmetric ULA beams and one
      asymmetric UCA beam). For each beam the system measures RSSI (time-averaged magnitude squared of the
      received signal) and compares RSSI differences with the differential gain expected from array patterns.
      A least-squares / cost-function search over azimuths finds candidate angles; the UCA asymmetric beam
      disambiguates the two symmetric solutions. When the predicted angle falls in a low-sensitivity central
      region, the algorithm swaps in an alternative differential beam (UCA + phase-offset ULA) to improve slope
      and resolution. The full derivation and equations (array factors, cost functions) are in the report.
    </p>

    <h3>Results & Impact</h3>
    <p>
      Simulation results show large improvements from the final version of the estimator:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Final-version average errors (azimuth) by iteration count: <strong>n=10 → 0.0788°</strong>, <strong>n=20 → 0.0751°</strong>,
          <strong>n=30 → 0.0724°</strong>. These are the tabulated averages reported in the project.</li>
      <li>Conditioning the algorithm on predicted angle and swapping to a steeper differential beam significantly reduced central-region error (report shows the comparative plots and per-angle error figures; see pages with Figs. 24–29).</li>
      <li>The approach reduces hardware complexity by removing the need for precise phase measurements — useful for IRS deployments where low-cost sensors are preferred.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Contributions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Developed a robust phaseless DoA algorithm combining ULA and UCA beam patterns and a differential-gain cost function.</li>
      <li>Introduced a conditioned beam swap to fix the low-sensitivity central region and dramatically lower mean/max errors in simulation.</li>
      <li>Proposed an optimization formulation to choose array weights that maximize differential-beam slope over a target azimuth range (work in progress).</li>
    </ol>
